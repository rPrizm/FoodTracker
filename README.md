# FoodTracker
my first project, the goal is to make a cmd python program that asks what you ate, and adds it to a calorie count and a protein count. it will also save these values to a txt file where they can be refrenced for easier use.
commands:
food
pulls up the food tracker
counts
shows calorie and protein counts
meditation
pulls up a stop watch to meditate, adds it to the log
medlogs or meditation logs
pulls up how long you meditated each day
